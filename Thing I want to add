My Cultivation Mod Ideas 

• Spatial ring / pouch
		A ring/bag/backpack that give you a extra inventory in a different dimension 
		You cannot store living things in it without the upgrade
		It is bound to you with Breath
		Can use without Breath but it is dropped on death

• Forging of seven hells
		forging of seven hells is technique where you consume heath to make your body stronger
		In game you loss 1 hp permanently every time this technique is used but you game a armor point
		When you die it all progress on the technique resets 
		After beat a boss(to be determined ) you gain back the hp you used x2 and get to keep the armor points
		It also increases your aptitude which make Breath gain faster

• Spirit Grass
		A grass that grows randomly throughout the world
		When broken with shears it produces the grass if broken with any thing else produces Breath grass fiber
		Used in alchemy(Such as the Breath foundation pill)
		Breath grass fiber is used to make cultivation clothes that boost your Breath regen
